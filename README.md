# Java
This project was done as a part of the Coursera Course by Duke University on data structures using java 
The course provided a walk through from simple encryption and decryption to breaking more and more complex codes as the course progressed.
The vigener cipher, caesars cipher to name a few. 
Towards the end language was also taken into account.

Improvements that can be made- Multithreading can certainly be introduced as it would lower the runtime which in the last assignment 
(in which 5 languages were considered) was decently high.
We can add some front end interface for now it is just run on developement environment
(I used Duke's version of BlueJ (It had some custom methods to make file handling easier).
